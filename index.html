<h2>Welcome we are glad you are ready to learn the truth</h2>
<p2>Everybody thinks we landed on this small planet called the moon, but we honestly did.
Now let us talk history. The "Moon landing" was a project attempted in 1969 by the new space agency.
NASA. At the time, Kennedy had to worry about wars in Korea, Vietnam and the ongoing cold war with 
the USSR. The United States needed more money to sponsor this project. The head of the Space agency Tomahs
Keith Glenan had said to President Kennedy, "Sir, we do not have enough money to fund this operation." Kennedy still had
not given up and was not licked, so he delayed all other advancements and funded the project. According to Buzz Aldrin
Neil Armstrong and John Glenn said they were in space. If you were to look at the United States' receipts and records, you would see
that Nasa had spent a ton of money on the engines ,bolts, and other much-needed parts.</p2> <br>


</br><p1>The common myths about the "faked Moon Landing" are heinous and ridiculous. For example, if you were
    to search online for the myths, you would see that a camera could not send signals that far back to Earth, but that is false.
    Radio signals have to power to travel through space and Earth's atmosphere. So the live recording from the moon
    landing is accurate. Another unreasonable and weird myth about the moon landing is people saying that if you were to go out into space,
    you would not survive the Earth's radiation. This myth is easily busted. For example, if you were to walk among an ice glacier, you 
    would want to walk as quickly and smoothly as possible, so that is what Nasa did; they made sure they were traveling at about the 
    right speed to avoid Earth's radiation belt.</p1><br>

</br><p2>Now to conclude, the moon landing is real and could not have been faked for numerous reasons. Radio signals can 
    travel through space. Kennedy had delayed all the projects to fund Appolo 11. Finally, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin could have easily
    survived the earth's radiation field as NASA had correctly calculated the speed required to move through the belt quickly.</p2>
